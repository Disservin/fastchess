# Fastchess

[![Fastchess](https://github.com/Disservin/fastchess/actions/workflows/fastchess.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Disservin/fastchess/actions/workflows/fastchess.yml)

Fastchess is a versatile command-line tool designed for running chess engine
tournaments.  
Written primarily in C++17, it utilizes [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) as its testing
framework.

With Fastchess, you can effortlessly orchestrate chess tournaments, configure
time controls, and execute matches concurrently for optimal time efficiency.
Extensively tested for high concurrency (supporting up to 250 threads) with
short time controls (0.2+0.002s), it exhibits minimal timeout issues, with only
10 matches out of 20,000 experiencing timeouts.

## What's New

- **Enhanced Cutechess Output**: The Cutechess output support has been refined to
  enhance compatibility with other tools. Simply switch the `-output` option to
  cutechess to enable it.
- **Extended PGN Data**: You can now track nodes, seldepth, nps (nodes per
  second), hashfull, and tbhits in the PGN output. Refer to the `-pgnout`
  option for detailed information.
- **Quick Match Option**: We've introduced a `-quick` option for running quick
  matches between two engines with a specified book. Specify
  `-quick cmd=ENGINE1 cmd=ENGINE2 book=BOOK` to swiftly initiate a match.

- **GZIP Compression for logs**: The logs are now compressed using GZIP to
  reduce disk space usage. You can enable this feature adding `ZLIB=true` to
  the `make` command and the enabling the `compress=true` option for the log.
  **Compiling with ZLIB=true will include _gzstream_ a wrapper for zlib from**  
  **Deepak Bandyopadhyay and Lutz Kettner, which is licensed under LGPL.**

## Quick start

### Building from source

Building Fastchess from source is straightforward. Just follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Disservin/fastchess.git`
2. Navigate to the Fastchess directory `cd fastchess`
3. Build the executable `make -j` for GCC and `make -j CXX=clang++` for Clang (requires GCC >= 7.3.0 or Clang >= 8.0.0).

### Download the latest release

Prefer a pre-compiled version?

Download the latest release from our [release page](https://github.com/Disservin/fastchess/releases).

Current dev versions are available as artifacts from the [CI](https://github.com/Disservin/fastchess/actions?query=is%3Asuccess+event%3Apush+branch%3Amaster).

### Example usage

Here's an example of how to use Fastchess:

```bash
fastchess.exe -engine cmd=Engine1.exe name=Engine1 -engine cmd=Engine2.exe
name=Engine2 -each tc=10+0.1 -rounds 200 -repeat -concurrency 4
```

_Note: It is highly encouraged to use an opening book._
