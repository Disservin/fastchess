FAST-CHESS            General Commands Manual            FAST-CHESS

NAME
       fast-chess - a command-line tool for managing chess games with engines

SYNOPSIS
       fast-chess [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
        Fast-chess is a command-line tool designed to manage and orchestrate
        chess games between engines. It provides a range of options to configure
        game settings, engine parameters, concurrency, and output formats.

OPTIONS
        The following options are available:

        -quick cmd=ENGINE1 cmd=ENGINE2 book=BOOK
            Shortcut for predefined game settings involving two engines, time controls,
            rounds, and concurrency.

        -event NAME
            Set the event name for the PGN header.

        -site NAME
            Set the site name for the PGN header.

        -config [file=NAME] [discard=(true|false)] [outname=NAME] [stats=(true|false)]
            Load engine configurations to resume games from previous sessions.

            file - the file name to load the configuration from.
            discard - discard the saved game results. Defaults to false.
            outname - the auto generated file name of the config. Default is "config.json".
            stats - load the stats from the config file. Defaults to true.

        -concurrency N
            Play N games concurrently. Default value is 1.

        --force-concurrency
            Ignore the hardware concurrency limit and force the specified concurrency.

        -rounds N
            Play N rounds of games. Default value is 2.

        -games N
            Play N games in each round. Default value is 2. 
            This should be set to 1 or 2, setting this higher than 2 does not
            provide meaningful results.

        -variant VARIANT
            standard     - play Standard Chess (default)
            fischerandom - play Fischer Random Chess

        -repeat
            Set the number of games to 2. This is equivalent to -games 2.

        -recover
            Enables crash recovery. This will attempt to recover the engine after a crash,
            to continue with the tournament.

        -draw movenumber=NUMBER movecount=COUNT score=SCORE
            Enables draw adjudication. Set conditions for a draw based on the number of moves,
            move count, and score threshold.
              
                NUMBER - the number of moves before checking for a draw.
                         Default value is 0.
                COUNT  - the number of consecutive moves below the score threshold to adjudicate a draw.
                         Pawn moves and captures resets the counter.
                         Default value is 1.
                SCORE  - the score threshold (in centipawns) for a draw.
                         Default value is 0.

        -resign movecount=COUNT score=SCORE [twosided=(true|false)]
            Enables engine resignation. Configure when the engine should resign based on move
            count and score threshold.

                twosided - if set to true, enables two-sided resignation.
                           Defaults to false.
                COUNT    - the number of consecutive moves above the score threshold before resigning.
                           Default value is 1.
                SCORE    - the score threshold (in centipawns) to resign at.
                           Default value is 0.

        -maxmoves N
            Enables draw adjudication by maximum number of moves.
            If the number of moves of the game reaches N without result, the game ends in a draw.

        -openings file=NAME format=(epd|pgn) [order=ORDER] [plies=PLIES] [start=START]
            Specify an opening book file and its format for game starting positions.

                format - the file format, either epd or pgn.
                ORDER  - the order of openings to be played, either random or sequential.
                         Default is sequential.
                PLIES  - the number of plies to use (for pgn only).
                         If not specified, uses the maximum available plies.
                START  - the starting index of the opening book.
                         Default value is 1.

            Export the final position of each game in EPD format.

        -noswap
            If specified, prevents swapping of colors. The first engine listed will always play as white.

        -ratinginterval N
            Set the rating interval for the rating report. For penta reports,
            this is reports per N game pair. Setting it to 0 will disable it. 
            Default value is 10.

        -scoreinterval N
            For cutechess output only. Set the interval for printing score results.

        -sprt elo0=ELO0 elo1=ELO1 alpha=ALPHA beta=BETA model=MODEL
            Set parameters for the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT).
            For more information see
            https://tests.stockfishchess.org/sprt_calc

            MODEL
                Specify the model to use.
                    logistic   - uses regular/logistic Elo for elo0 and elo1.
                    bayesian   - uses bayesElo for elo0 and elo1.
                    normalized - uses nElo for elo0 and elo1. (default)

        -srand SEED
            Specify the seed for opening book randomization. Otherwise, the chosen seed will be 
            a random integer value between 0 and (2^64 - 1).

        -log file=NAME level=LEVEL compress=(true|false) realtime=(true|false)
            Specify a log file with a specific log level. 
            Set compress to true if you want the log file to be gzipped. Default is false.
            Specifying a level will only print/save the specified level and the levels above that.
            Level "trace" is only ever saved to a file and never printed to the console.
            By default engine logs will be written in realtime this adds a small overhead which
            might lead to timeouts for very short time controls, to counteract this set it to false.

            LEVEL
                trace
                warn (default)
                info 
                err
                fatal

        -use-affinity
            Enable thread affinity for bindings engines to specific CPU cores.

        -report penta=(true|false)
            Reports pentanomial statistics (only for fastchess output). Defaults to true.
            For more information see https://www.chessprogramming.org/Match_Statistics

        -version
            Print the version number and exit.
        
        -help
            Print a help message and exit.

        -each OPTIONS
            Apply specified OPTIONS to both engines.

        -engine OPTIONS
            Apply specified OPTIONS to the next engine.

            cmd=COMMAND
                Specify the engine command.

            name=NAME
                Set the engine name. Must be unique.

            [args="ARGS"]
                If you want to pass multiple arguments, use args="ARG1 ARG2 ARG3".
                Please note that double quotes inside the string must be escaped, 
                e.g., args="single words \"multiple words\"" -> your engine will receive

                single
                words
                multiple words

            [tc=TC] 
                TC uses the same format as Cute-Chess, which is moves/minutes:seconds+increment. For example,
                10+0.1 would be 10 seconds with 100 ms increment and 40/1:0 would be 40 moves every minute.
            
            [timemargin=N]
                Allows the engine to exceed the time limit by N milliseconds.
                Default value is 0.

            [st=ST]
                Movetime for the engine in seconds.
            
            [nodes=NODES]
                Maximum number of nodes to search. If supported.
            
            [plies=PLIES]
                Plies (depth) to search. If supported.
            
            [depth=DEPTH]
                Depth to search. If supported. Does the same as plies.

            [proto=PROTOCOL]
                Specify the communication protocol. Only supports uci.

            [dir=DIRECTORY]
                Working directory for the engine.

            [option.name=VALUE]
                This can be used to set engine options. Note that the engine must support the option.
                For example, to set the hash size to 128MB, use option.Hash=128.


EXAMPLES
        To start a match between two engines using a random order of openings from book.epd:
            $ fast-chess -engine cmd=Engine1.exe name=Engine1 -engine cmd=Engine2.exe \
              name=Engine2 -openings file=book.epd format=epd order=random \
              -each tc=10+0.1 -rounds 200 -repeat -concurrency 4

        To resume a match from a saved configuration:
            $ fast-chess -config file=config.json
