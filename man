FASTCHESS            General Commands Manual            FASTCHESS

NAME
       fastchess - a command-line tool for managing chess games with engines

SYNOPSIS
       fastchess [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
        fastchess is a command-line tool designed to manage and orchestrate
        chess games between engines. It provides a range of options to configure
        game settings, engine parameters, concurrency, and output formats.

OPTIONS
        The following options are available:

        -quick cmd=ENGINE1 cmd=ENGINE2 book=BOOK
            Shortcut for predefined game settings involving two engines, time controls,
            rounds, and concurrency.

        -event NAME
            Set the event name for the PGN header.

        -site NAME
            Set the site name for the PGN header.

        -config [file=NAME] [discard=(true|false)] [outname=NAME] [stats=(true|false)]
            Load engine configurations to resume games from previous sessions.

            file - the file name to load the configuration from.
            discard - discard the saved game results. Defaults to false.
            outname - the auto generated file name of the config. Default is "config.json".
            stats - load the stats from the config file. Defaults to true.

        -concurrency N
            Play N games concurrently, limited by the number of hardware threads. Default value is 1.

        --force-concurrency
            Ignore the hardware concurrency limit and force the specified concurrency.

        -rounds N
            Play N rounds of games where each game within the round uses the same opening. Default value is 2.

        -games N
            Play N games in each round. Default value is 2. 
            This should be set to 1 or 2, setting this higher than 2 does not
            provide meaningful results.

        -variant VARIANT
            standard     - play Standard Chess (default)
            fischerandom - play Fischer Random Chess

        -repeat
            Set the number of games to 2. This is equivalent to -games 2.

        -recover
            Enables crash recovery. This will attempt to recover the engine after a crash,
            to continue with the tournament.

        -draw movenumber=NUMBER movecount=COUNT score=SCORE
            Enables draw adjudication. Set conditions for a draw based on the number of moves,
            move count, and score threshold.
              
                NUMBER - the number of moves before checking for a draw.
                         Default value is 0.
                COUNT  - the number of consecutive moves below the score threshold to adjudicate a draw.
                         Pawn moves and captures resets the counter.
                         Default value is 1.
                SCORE  - the score threshold (in centipawns) for a draw.
                         Default value is 0.

        -resign movecount=COUNT score=SCORE [twosided=(true|false)]
            Enables engine resignation. Configure when the engine should resign based on move
            count and score threshold.

                twosided - if set to true, enables two-sided resignation.
                           Defaults to false.
                COUNT    - the number of consecutive moves above the score threshold before resigning.
                           Default value is 1.
                SCORE    - the score threshold (in centipawns) to resign at.
                           Default value is 0.

        -maxmoves N
            Enables draw adjudication by maximum number of moves.
            If the number of moves of the game reaches N without result, the game ends in a draw.

        -openings file=NAME format=(epd|pgn) [order=ORDER] [plies=PLIES] [start=START]
            Specify an opening book file and its format for game starting positions.

                         Default is sequential.
                PLIES  - the number of plies to use (for pgn only).
                         If not specified, uses the maximum available plies.
                START  - the starting index of the opening book.
                         Default value is 1.

        -ratinginterval N
            Set the rating interval for the rating report. For penta reports,
            this is reports per N game pair. Setting it to 0 will disable it. 
            Default value is 10.

        -scoreinterval N
            For cutechess output only. Set the interval for printing score results.

        -sprt elo0=ELO0 elo1=ELO1 alpha=ALPHA beta=BETA model=MODEL
            Set parameters for the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT).
            For more information see
            https://tests.stockfishchess.org/sprt_calc

            MODEL
                Specify the model to use.
                    logistic   - uses regular/logistic Elo for elo0 and elo1.
                    bayesian   - uses bayesElo for elo0 and elo1.
                    normalized - uses nElo for elo0 and elo1. (default)

        -srand SEED
            Specify the seed for opening book randomization. Otherwise, the chosen seed will be 
            a random integer value between 0 and (2^64 - 1).

        -log file=NAME level=LEVEL compress=(true|false) realtime=(true|false)
            Specify a log file with a specific log level. 
            Set compress to true if you want the log file to be gzipped. Default is false.
            Specifying a level will only print/save the specified level and the levels above that.
            Level "trace" is only ever saved to a file and never printed to the console.
            By default engine logs will be written in realtime this adds a small overhead which
            might lead to timeouts for very short time controls, to counteract this set it to false.

            LEVEL
                trace
                warn (default)
                info 
                err
                fatal

            Enable thread affinity for bindings engines to specific CPU cores.

        -report penta=(true|false)
            Reports pentanomial statistics (only for fastchess output). Defaults to true.
            For more information see https://www.chessprogramming.org/Match_Statistics

        -version
            Print the version number and exit.
        
        -help
            Print a help message and exit.

        -each OPTIONS
            Apply specified OPTIONS to both engines.

        -engine OPTIONS
            Apply specified OPTIONS to the next engine.

            cmd=COMMAND
                Specify the engine command.

            name=NAME
                Set the engine name. Must be unique.

            [args="ARGS"]
                If you want to pass multiple arguments, use args="ARG1 ARG2 ARG3".
                Please note that double quotes inside the string must be escaped, 
                e.g., args="single words \"multiple words\"" -> your engine will receive

                single
                words
                multiple words

            [tc=TC] 
                TC uses the same format as Cute-Chess, which is moves/minutes:seconds+increment. For example,
                10+0.1 would be 10 seconds with 100 ms increment and 40/1:0 would be 40 moves every minute.
            
            [timemargin=N]
                Allows the engine to exceed the time limit by N milliseconds.
                Default value is 0.

            [st=ST]
                Movetime for the engine in seconds.
            
            [nodes=NODES]
                Maximum number of nodes to search. If supported.
            
            [plies=PLIES]
                Maximum number of plies (depth) to search. If supported.
            
            [depth=DEPTH]
                Maximum number of depth to search. If supported. Does the same as plies.

            [proto=PROTOCOL]
                Specify the communication protocol. Only supports uci.

            [dir=DIRECTORY]
                Working directory for the engine.

            [option.name=VALUE]
                This can be used to set engine options. Note that the engine must support the option.
                For example, to set the hash size to 128MB, use option.Hash=128.


EXAMPLES
        To start a match between two engines using a random order of openings from book.epd:
            $ fastchess -engine cmd=Engine1.exe name=Engine1 -engine cmd=Engine2.exe \
              name=Engine2 -openings file=book.epd format=epd order=random \
              -each tc=10+0.1 -rounds 200 -repeat -concurrency 4

        To resume a match from a saved configuration:
            $ fastchess -config file=config.json
