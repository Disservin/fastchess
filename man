NAME
       fast-chess - a command-line tool for managing chess games with engines

SYNOPSIS
       fast-chess [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
        Fast-chess is a command-line tool designed to manage and orchestrate
        chess games between engines. It provides a range of options to configure
        game settings, engine parameters, concurrency, and output formats.

OPTIONS
        The following options are available:

        -quick cmd=ENGINE1 cmd=ENGINE2 book=BOOK
            Shortcut for predefined game settings involving two engines, time controls,
            rounds, and concurrency.

        -event NAME
            Set the event name for the PGN header.

        -site NAME
            Set the site name for the PGN header.

        -config file=NAME [discard=(true|false)]
            Load engine configurations to resume games from previous sessions.
            Use 'discard=true' to discard saved game results. defaults to false.

        -concurrency N
            Plays N matches concurrently. Default value is 1.

        -rounds N
            Play N rounds of games. Default value is 2.

        -games N
            Play N games in each round. Default value is 2. 
            This should be set to 1 or 2, setting this higher than 2 does not
            provide meaningful results.

        -variant VARIANT
            standard     - play Standard Chess (default)
            fischerandom - play Fischer Random Chess

        -repeat
            Sets the number of games to 2. This is equivalent to -games 2.

        -recover
            Enables crash recovery. This will attempt to recover the engine after a crash,
            to continue with the tournament.

        -draw movenumber=NUMBER movecount=COUNT score=SCORE
            Enables draw adjudication. Set conditions for a draw based on the number of moves,
            move count, and score threshold.
              
                NUMBER - the number of moves before checking for a draw.
                         Default value is 0.
                COUNT  - the number of moves below the score threshold to adjudicate a draw.
                         Default value is 1.
                SCORE  - the score threshold (in centipawns) for a draw.
                         Default value is 0.

        -resign movecount=COUNT score=SCORE
            Enables engine resignation. Configure when the engine should resign based on move
            count and score threshold.

                COUNT - the number of moves to make before resigning. Default value is 1.
                SCORE - the score threshold (in centipawns) to resign at. Default value is 0.

        -openings file=NAME format=(epd|pgn) [order=ORDER] [plies=PLIES] [start=START]
            Specify an opening book file and its format for game starting positions.

                format - the file format, either epd or pgn.
                ORDER  - the order of moves to be played, either random or sequential.
                         Default is random.
                PLIES  - the number of plies to use (for pgn only).
                         If not specified, uses the maximum available plies.
                START  - the starting offset (number of openings to skip).
                         Default value is 0.

        -output format=FORMAT
            Choose the output format for game results (cutechess or fastchess).
            Default is fastchess.

                Set the engine name. Must be unique.

            [args="ARGS"]
                If you want to pass multiple arguments, use args="ARG1 ARG2 ARG3".
                Please note that double quotes inside the string must be escaped, 
                e.g., args="single words \"multiple words\"" -> your engine will receive

                single
                words
                multiple words

            [tc=TC] 
                TC uses the same format as Cute-Chess. For example,
                10+0.1 would be 10 seconds with 100 millisecond increments.
            
            [timemargin=N]
                Allows the engine to exceed the time limit by N milliseconds.

                Specify the communication protocol. Only supports uci.

            [dir=DIRECTORY]
                Working directory for the engine.

            [option.name=VALUE]
                This can be used to set engine options. Note that the engine must support the option.
                For example, to set the hash size to 128MB, use option.Hash=128.


EXAMPLES
        To start a game between two engines using specific configurations:
            $ fast-chess -engine cmd=Engine1.exe name=Engine1 -engine cmd=Engine2.exe \
              name=Engine2 -openings file=book.epd format=epd order=random \
              -each tc=10+0.1 -randomseed -rounds 200 -repeat -concurrency 4

        To resume a game from a saved configuration:
            $ fast-chess -config file=config.json
