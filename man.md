# NAME

fastchess - a command-line tool for managing chess games with engines

# SYNOPSIS

fastchess [OPTIONS]

# DESCRIPTION

fastchess is a command-line tool designed to manage and orchestrate chess games between engines. It provides a range of options to configure game settings, engine parameters, concurrency, and output formats.

# OPTIONS

The following options are available:

- -quick cmd=ENGINE1 cmd=ENGINE2 book=BOOK  
    Shortcut for predefined game settings involving two engines, time controls, rounds, and concurrency.

- -event NAME  
    Set the event name for the PGN header.

- -site NAME  
    Set the site name for the PGN header.

- -config [file=NAME] [discard=(true|false)] [outname=NAME] [stats=(true|false)]  
    Load engine configurations to resume games from previous sessions.

    - file - the file name to load the configuration from.
    - discard - discard the loaded configuration after loading. Defaults to false. This lets you specify a filename to save the
      configuration to, while ignoring it for the current session.
    - outname - the auto-generated file name of the config. Default is "config.json".
    - stats - load the stats from the config file. Defaults to true.

- -concurrency N  
    Play N games concurrently, limited by the number of hardware threads. Default value is 1.

- --compliance ENGINE [ARGS]  
    Check the UCI compliance of an engine by running it with the specified arguments.

- -crc32 pgn=true
    Calculate the CRC32 checksum for the PGN file.

- --force-concurrency  
    Ignore the hardware concurrency limit and force the specified concurrency.

- -rounds N  
    Play N rounds of games where each game within the round uses the same opening. Default value is 2.

- -games N  
    Play N games in each round. Default value is 2. Setting this higher than 2 does not provide meaningful results.

- -variant VARIANT  
    Choose between the following game variants:

    - standard - play Standard Chess (default)
    - fischerandom - play Fischer Random Chess

- -tournament TYPE
    Choose type of tournament:

    - roundrobin
    - gauntlet

- -seeds N
    First N engines are playing the gauntlet. Default value is 1.

- -repeat  
    Set the number of games to 2. Equivalent to -games 2.

- -recover  
    Enables crash recovery to attempt to recover the engine after a crash and continue the tournament.

- -show-latency
    Show the "think" latency (difference between measured and reported time) for each engine.
    Note that a lot of engines add 1ms to the time they report, so the latency will be 1ms higher than the actual latency.
    It is also possible that the latency is negative, due to different measurement methods or missing synchronization of the clocks
    between different threads.

- -testEnv
    Specifies that the program is running in a test environment (OpenBench/Fishtest). This will change some outputs/settings.

- -draw movenumber=NUMBER movecount=COUNT score=SCORE  
    Enables draw adjudication based on number of moves, move count, and score threshold.

    - NUMBER - number of moves before checking for a draw. Default is 0.
    - COUNT - number of consecutive moves below the score threshold. Default is 1.
    - SCORE - score threshold (in centipawns) for a draw. Default is 0.

- -resign movecount=COUNT score=SCORE [twosided=(true|false)]  
    Configures engine resignation based on move count and score threshold.

    - twosided - if true, enables two-sided resignation. Defaults to false.
    - COUNT - number of consecutive moves above the score threshold. Default is 1.
    - SCORE - score threshold (in centipawns) to resign. Default is 0.

- -maxmoves N  
    Enables draw adjudication if the game reaches N moves without a result.

- -tb PATHS  
    Adjudicate games using Syzygy tablebases. PATHS must be a semicolon-separated (on Windows) or colon-separated (other platforms)
    list of paths to the tablebase directories.
    Only the WDL tablebase files are required.

- -tbpieces N  
    Only use tablebase adjudication for positions with N pieces or less.

- -tbignore50  
    Disable the fifty move rule for tablebase adjudication.

- -openings file=NAME format=(epd|pgn) [order=ORDER] [plies=PLIES] [start=START]  
    Specifies an opening book file and its format for game starting positions.

    - format - file format, either epd or pgn.
    - ORDER - order of openings (random or sequential). Default is sequential.
    - PLIES - number of plies for pgn. Defaults to max available plies.
    - START - starting index of the opening book. Default is 1.

- -output format=FORMAT  
    Choose the output format for game results (cutechess or fastchess). Default is fastchess.

- -pgnout file=NAME notation=(san|lan|uci) [nodes=(true|false)] [seldepth=(true|false)] [nps=(true|false)] [hashfull=(true|false)] [tbhits=(true|false)] [timeleft=(true|false)] [latency=(true|false)] [min=(true|false)] [match_line=REGEX]
